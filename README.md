# ID Assignment 1

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 


My project is to promote the KSI Tour tickets. My website shows the concert expectations as well as videos and even history of KSI for people to get more information on him
having concert videos, as well as some of him songs as showcase of what he can perform on stage. My website is able to let you know the schedule of the tour and whether the tickets are sold out.
 
 
 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

My design process on my website is to create an artistic and aesthetic website for the users. I also wanted the website to be able for people to easily nagivate through the website. As a user on my website, i want to visit the socials of KSI, i can just scroll down and click on the icons which would direct me to the respective social media.
I design the website with simple paragraphs and kept the colours used in my website so it does not look too colourful and messy. I place the boxes around the website page so that there would not be any awkward spaces in the website page. (Adobe XD)- https://xd.adobe.com/view/22dbff59-d3c2-4a43-bfa7-afd41bd21328-7788/ 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

- Drop down box 
   At the About me section, when the mouse hovers over the button there will be a drop down box that appears allowing you to choose the page to visit
- Slideshow
   This is done with css styling as well as java script, you are able to click the next button and it would show the next picture along with the feature of showing 1/3 to 3/3.
- Ticket Button
   The ticket button would be able to direct you to the official website shop, When hovered over it would grow redder and a background shadow will be shown.
- Navigation bar buttons
   Buttons will glow red when hovered
 
### Existing Features

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
i want to add more animations to my website so that it will look nicer. Small animations like beeping light or a gif icon.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
